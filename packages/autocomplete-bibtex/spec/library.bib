@article{Swan2008,
abstract = {The structure and development of a new state-of-the-art hybrid energy end-use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions model of the Canadian housing stock (CHS), with the capability of accurately determining the effects of renewable energy technologies, is presented. The model incorporates a 17,000 house database developed using the latest data available from the EnerGuide for Houses database, Statistics Canada housing surveys, and other available housing databases. The geometry and thermal envelope of each house is defined in detail, making it suitable for energy simulation based on engineering methods (thermodynamics and heat transfer). The model utilizes the ESP-r building energy simulation program as its simulation engine. To account for effects due to occupant behaviour, a new neural network methodology is utilized to estimate the demographic dependencies of the annual energy consumption of discretionary end-uses such as appliances, lighting and domestic hot water. A new approach is used to allot the annual energy consumption of discretionary end-uses to hourly or sub-hourly intervals based on occupancy, appliance, lighting and domestic hot water load profiles. Each house’s profiles are incorporated into the model as loads, a portion of which becomes internal heat gain for inclusion in the space heating/cooling simulation conducted using ESP-r. A new method is used to calculate the GHG emissions from electricity consumption used in the residential sector based on the actual electrical generation fuel mix and the marginal fuel used in each province as a function of the time of year. The developing hybrid model will predict energy consumption and GHG emissions of the CHS based on the latest available stock databases and surveys and uses multiple simulation methods to account for envelope losses and occupant behaviour. When complete, the model may be used to assess the impacts of envelope upgrades or the addition of renewable energy technologies based on high resolution, targeted application.},

abstract = {A new simplified method for calculating the monthly solar heating fraction of direct gain buildings is presented. Two different operating regimes have been considered: (1) thermostatically controlled temperature, typical of buildings with auxiliary heating systems; and (2) free-floating temperature, typical of buildings without auxiliary heating systems. In the latter case, to quantify the thermal behaviour of the building, a comfort solar fraction is introduced. In this method, the solar fraction is a function of three parameters: (1) the solar/load ratio; (2) the building thermal inertia; and (3) the monthly non-utilizability. Some examples of the application of the new method are presented, as well as comparisons with the results from existing methods.},

@article{Elman1990,
abstract = {Time underlies many interesting human behaviors. Thus, the question of how to represent time in connectionist models is very important. One approach is to represent time implicitly by its effects on processing rather than explicitly (as in a spatial representation). The current report develops a proposal along these lines first described by Jordan (1986) which involves the use of recurrent links in order to provide networks with a dynamic memory. In this approach, hidden unit patterns are fed back to themselves; the internal representations which develop thus reflect task demands in the context of prior internal states. A set of simulations is reported which range from relatively simple problems (temporal version of XOR) to discovering syntactic/semantic features for words. The networks are able to learn interesting internal representations which incorporate task demands with memory demands; indeed, in this approach the notion of memory is inextricably bound up with task processing. These representations reveal a rich structure, which allows them to be highly context-dependent, while also expressing generalizations across classes of items. These representations suggest a method for representing lexical categories and the type/token distinction.},

abstract = {This paper sets out the results of the York Energy Demonstration Project and discusses its implications for the modernisation of low rise housing in the UK. The project consisted of three schemes, which were carried out in the early to mid 1990s and monitored over a 2-year period. Results indicate that modernisation schemes have a very important part to play in reducing CO2 emissions and that improvements in the region of 50\% can be achieved at modest cost using well proven (early 1980s) technology. The possibility of additional improvements are also identified which could see emissions fall by a further 30–40\%. In addition, the project identifies difficulties posed by, often small, variations in dwelling construction, which can have a disproportionate impact on costs, and by the design and use of mixed heating systems which can reduce overall heating efficiencies. The paper also discusses the impact of the demonstration project on the dissemination of good energy efficient practice within the Local Authority and highlights the lessons learned for implementation in future modernisation schemes.},

@article{Deurinck2012,
abstract = {In the debate on predicting household energy savings, the temperature takeback – an increased indoor temperature after an energy efficient retrofit – is often blamed for offsetting part of the potential energy savings. Mostly, it is attributed to inhabitants grading up their heating behaviour to the lower energy cost after retrofit. However, even if inhabitants do not change their heating pattern, the indoor temperature will still rise after retrofit due to physical processes: warmer unheated zones and less temperature drop between two heating periods. This paper uses building energy simulation tools to assess the extent of these physical processes in the overall temperature rise. An existing terraced house is modelled and fictitious renovation measures are imposed, keeping the heating patterns unchanged. For the case analysed, a heating season mean indoor temperature rise of about 1°C is found, being in the same order of magnitude as empirically detected temperature changes. This suggests that the remaining behavioural aspect of the temperature takeback might be smaller than generally assumed. In addition, the comparison is made with a calculation method based on the EPBD regulation that does not take into account the physical temperature rise. The latter method overestimates the potential energy savings by about 6\%.},

abstract = {A large-scale continuous campaign management model-based approach that places value on variables that are broad, difficult to measure, and changing with time (from the perspective of behavioral change) does not exist at this time of writing. This research seeks to identify a model-based approach to continuously optimize an energy efficiency campaign. A literature review of traditional approaches to campaign management finds that behavioral variables, as well as economic variables, are important in campaign design, and that these types of campaigns need to be up-scaled and applied to a broad audience. A literature review of models is completed within the categories of measurement and verification, behavioral change campaigns, project management, and strategic management to identify an approach to continuous campaign management. Determined to be the best approach for the current research, the balanced scorecard (Kaplan and Norton 1992) is adapted to a campaign perspective. Through seven expert interviews, the proposed approach is applied to seven campaigns in operation. Expert feedback of the proposed approach is recorded and compared with literature theory to gain understanding of gaps between the two. The largest gap is identified in the management of learning and innovation, both in theory and practice. Finally, an updated approach is presented based on expert feedback, and an extension of the current approach is offered by the author for future research. Clay},

Simultaneously, the Poincar\'{e} recurrence time has been extensively used to characterize nonlinear dynamical systems. We compare the main properties of these statistical methods pointing out their consequences for the recurrence analysis performed in time series. In particular, we analyze the dependence of the mean recurrence time and of the recurrence time statistics on the probability density function, on the interval whereto the recurrences are observed, and on the temporal correlations of time series. In the case of long-term correlations, we verify the validity of the stretched exponential distribution, which is uniquely defined by the exponent gamma, at the same time showing that it is restricted to the class of linear long-term correlated processes. Simple transformations are able to modify the correlations of time series leading to stretched exponentials recurrence time statistics with different gamma, which shows a lack of invariance under the change of observables.},

abstract = {Much of plasma behaviour is governed by multiple distinct nonlinear processes, operating on a wide range of lengthscales and timescales, that are coupled together in innumerable feedback loops. Capturing and quantifying this nonlinear behaviour is crucial at all levels of description, ranging from individual events to global phenomenology. In recent years, a range of techniques derived from complex systems science has been applied successfully to nonlinear plasma datasets. The present paper reviews several of these techniques in the context of applications spanning fusion, space, solar and astrophysical plasmas. Topics include non-Gaussian probability density functions, notably extreme event distributions in fusion and astrophysics and power law distributions in the solar context; differencing and rescaling of fluctuation data, which has yielded information on the number of dominant plasma turbulent processes, and the spatiotemporal ranges over which they operate, in plasmas ranging from microquasar accretion discs to L-mode and dithering H-mode fusion plasmas in the MAST tokamak; quantitative measures of mutual information content and pattern repetition between causally linked but spatiotemporally separated nonlinear events in solar wind and magnetospheric plasmas; global statistics of full-disc solar irradiance; and ELMing, considered as a sequence of pulsed events, in H-mode fusion plasmas in the JET tokamak. These developments in nonlinear plasma data characterization provide fresh additional insights into the underlying plasma physics. They also provide new opportunities for comparing models with data, and with each other, and open avenues for the development of a more rigorous predictive capability in this field.},

abstract = {Guideline 14 was developed by ASHRAE to fill a need for a standardized set of energy (and demand) savings calculation procedures. The intent is to provide guidance on minimum acceptable levels of performance for determining energy and demand savings, using measurements, in commercial transactions. Note that it is entirely possible to have a sale/ purchase, lease, or other arrangement for energy-efficient equipment that does not involve measurements. Indeed, the vast majority of transactions are of this type. However, if the savings determination is to be based on measurements, certain minimum requirements are necessary in order to avoid a process that appears to be based on actual savings but might be highly inaccurate, biased, or random. It is expected that ASHRAE Guideline 14 will be used for transactions between energy service companies (ESCOs) and their customers and between ESCOs and utilities, where the utilities have elected to purchase energy savings. Use of ASHRAE Guideline 14 is expected to provide savings results sufficiently well specified and reasonably accurate so that the parties to the transaction can have adequate assurance for the payment basis. Other applications of ASHRAE Guideline 14 may include documenting energy savings for various credit programs, e.g., emission reduction credits associated with energy efficiency activities. Determining savings with measurements in accordance with this guideline involves measuring post-retrofit energy use and comparing that to the measured pre-retrofit use, adjusted or normalized, to act as a proxy for the conditions that would have prevailed had the retrofit not been performed. Therefore, determining energy savings through the use of measurements involves more than just verifying that new equipment has been installed and can function as expected, although those tasks are usually a necessary part of determining savings. In addition, energy savings cannot be claimed to be “measured” if no pre-retrofit data are available. Sampling is often used in projects involving end-use monitoring or what we call the “retrofit isolation approach.” Annex B gives procedures to calculate the added uncertainty due to sampling. ASHRAE Guideline 14 may be used to measure the energy savings from a utility sponsored or contracted multiple-building energy conservation project. Applying ASHRAE Guideline 14 to such a project would allow the use of Annex B to calculate the measurement uncertainty directly. The net impacts of large-scale utility energy conservation programs, such as those that may involve market transformation or standard offers for purchase of conservation energy, are specifically excluded from the scope of ASHRAE Guideline 14, although individual and multiple-building projects within such programs are covered. ASHRAE Guideline 14 primarily addresses measurements of energy and demand for determining savings. Other tasks are needed in any energy performance contract. These can include determining appropriate utility rates, inspecting and commissioning equipment, etc. Users of ASHRAE Guideline 14 who are interested in learning more about some of thecontractual issues and types of performance contracts will find relevant discussion in the DOE publication “International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol” (IPMVP 2000) available at <www.ipmvp.org>.},

@article{Milne2000,
abstract = {The primary aim of this study was to analyse the significance of household temperature in determining the amount of potential energy savings taken back in the form of an increase in the comfort temperature following energy efficiency improvements. If the dual goals of energy conservation and affordable warmth for low-income households are to be attained, the nature of takeback must be more thoroughly understood so that the full benefit of energy efficiency measures can be assessed along with the carbon/energy savings. However, very little analysis has been carried out to quantify the benefit taken as warmth. This research examines the results of a number of monitored energy efficiency projects undertaken in Britain over the past 20 years to try to determine the most important influences on temperature takeback. The main findings are:•the internal temperature is the main determinant on the amount of benefit from energy efficiency measures that will be taken as an increase in comfort rather than as an energy saving;•at 16.5°C, the current average temperature of housing in Great Britain, about 30\% of the benefit of an energy efficiency improvement would be taken as a temperature increase and the rest as an energy saving;•at temperatures as low as 14°C — still frequently found in low-income households — only half of the energy saving will be achieved and the remainder would be taken as a temperature increase;•20°C is the most likely whole house comfort temperature in an energy efficient house and it is only in these circumstances that further improvements will achieve the full energy saving;•there has been a narrowing of the gap in average indoor winter temperatures of the different tenure types and tenure alone is no longer a definitive indicator of household temperature;•living room temperature is not a good indicator in the UK of whole house average temperature, as a warm living room may be found in an otherwise cold house, particularly in low-income households without central heating;•as there is now little difference between the average temperatures of local authority and owner occupied households, there should be little difference in the overall degree of takeback between these two tenures;•energy efficiency measures which increase radiant temperature, such as double glazing, enable the occupants to be comfortable at a lower air temperature and thus reduce the degree of takeback by up to 20\%;•there is a lack of suitably monitored and analysed projects to enable a rigorous assessment of takeback, particularly for higher income households;•the present low levels of warmth and slow rate of improvement in average temperatures will mean that investment in the energy efficiency of the UK housing stock will fail to achieve the predicted energy savings for at least another 15 years.},

abstract = {The present paper suggests a procedure for identification of suitable models for the heat dynamics of a building. Such a procedure for model identification is essential for better usage of readings from smart meters, which is expected to be installed in almost all buildings in the coming years. The models can be used for different purposes, e.g. control of the indoor climate, forecasting of energy consumption, and for accurate description of energy performance of the building. Grey-box models based on prior physical knowledge and data-driven modelling are applied. This facilitates insight into otherwise hidden information about the physical properties of the building. A hierarchy of models of increasing complexity is formulated based on prior physical knowledge and a forward selection strategy is suggested enabling the modeller to iteratively select suitable models of increasing complexity. The performance of the models is compared using likelihood ratio tests, and they are validated using a combination of appropriate statistics and physical interpretation of the results. A case study is described in which a suitable model is sought after for a single storey 120m2 building. The result is a set of different models of increasing complexity, with which building characteristics, such as: thermal conductivity, heat capacity of different parts, and window area, are estimated.},

abstract = {Buildings have been designed to use solar gains for winter heating for several millenia, but the quantitative basis for passive solar design has only been developed in the last decade. A simplified lumped capacitance model is used to provide insight into the physics of passive building behavior. Three passive design methods are described: the Solar Load Ratio (SLR) method based on correlations to simulation results; the Gordon/Zarmi closed form analytical mode;; and the ‘‘unutilizability’’ model of Monsen and Klein. Model predictions are compared with measured results; agreement is good if measured building characteristics are used. Numerous passive houses use less than 2 Btu/ft2‐DD for auxiliary heating and consensus is developing that modest levels of passive glazing combined with superinsulation techniques can provide the best feature of both approaches.},

abstract = {Like all industrialised countries, Belgium accepted to diminish its greenhouse gas emissions in the frame of the Kyoto agreement. On top of the list figures CO2. A major emission source for CO2 is burning fossil fuels. As the residential sector accounts for 28\% of the country’s annual energy consumption and as this consumption mainly concerns fossil fuels, it has an equally important share in the CO2 release. Hence, at first sight, the best policy for a decrease is by improving the energy efficiency. The question to be solved, however, is which improvement could generate the reduction needed? This study discusses a methodology and comments simulations that help in answering that question. The results are not as simple as one should like. The housing stock in fact acts as a conservatory system. For the case being, the impact of energy efficient new construction on the CO2 release remains quite marginal if the period considered does not extend beyond a decade. The effect becomes significant only over a longer period, on condition that more stringent energy efficiency measures are combined with a shift from new construction to retrofit and reconstruction.

abstract = {Estimates of daily electrical cooling load for a city of 800,000 are developed based on the relationship between weather variables and daily-average electricity consumption over 1 year. The relationship is found to be nearly linear above a threshold temperature. Temperature and humidity were found to be the largest, at 59\%, and second largest, at 21\%, contributors to electrical cooling load. Direct normal irradiation intercepted by a vertical cylinder, DNIsin$\theta$, was found to be a useful explanatory variable when modeling aggregates of buildings without a known or dominant orientation. The best study case model used DNIsin$\theta$ and diffuse horizontal irradiation (DHI) as distinct explanatory variables with annual electrical cooling load contributions of 9\% and 11\% respectively. Although the seasonal variation in electrical cooling load is large – on peak summer days more than 1.5 times the winter base load – the combined direct and diffuse solar contribution is essentially flat through the year, a condition at odds with the common assumption that solar cooling always provides a good match between supply and demand. The final model gives an electrical cooling load estimate for Abu Dhabi Island that corresponds to 40\% of the total annual electrical load and 61\% on the peak day.},

The new method is demonstrated to achieve consistent performance improvements over regular CART as well as over its extension to allow arbitrary hyperplane boundaries.

@article{Biddulph2014,
abstract = {Evaluating how much heat is lost through external walls is a key requirement for building energy simulators and is necessary for quality assurance and successful decision making in policy making and building design, construction and refurbishment. Heat loss can be estimated using the temperature differences between the inside and outside air and an estimate of the thermal transmittance (U-value) of the wall. Unfortunately the actual U-value may be different from those values obtained using assumptions about the materials, their properties and the structure of the wall after a cursory visual inspection. In-situ monitoring using thermometers and heat flux plates enables more accurate characterisation of the thermal properties of walls in their context. However, standard practices require that the measurements are carried out in winter over a two-week period to significantly reduce the dynamic effects of the wall's thermal mass from the data. A novel combination of a lumped thermal mass model, together with Bayesian statistical analysis is presented to derive estimates of the U-value and effective thermal mass. The method needs only a few days of measurements, provides an estimate of the effective thermal mass and could potentially be used in summer.},

American Housing Survey data was used to describe the low-income urban housing stock in six different cities representing a range of geographical and climatic areas. These data were then used to drive the Home Energy Saver model to simulate current energy consumption and expected energy savings from a combination of three weatherization treatments: replacing a standard thermostat with a programmable thermostat, installing attic insulation, and envelope air sealing. Modeled energy savings were compared to observed energy savings. Results show that greater energy saving potential generally exists in cities with colder climates, but the effectiveness of different weatherization treatments also varies with differences in regional housing stock and space conditioning equipment. This study's results and methodology could be used in future research to compare the cost-effectiveness and carbon reductions of potential weatherization programs.},

abstract = {This paper describes a new approach to online forecasting of power production from PV systems. The method is suited to online forecasting in many applications and in this paper it is used to predict hourly values of solar power for horizons of up to 36h. The data used is 15-min observations of solar power from 21 PV systems located on rooftops in a small village in Denmark. The suggested method is a two-stage method where first a statistical normalization of the solar power is obtained using a clear sky model. The clear sky model is found using statistical smoothing techniques. Then forecasts of the normalized solar power are calculated using adaptive linear time series models. Both autoregressive (AR) and AR with exogenous input (ARX) models are evaluated, where the latter takes numerical weather predictions (NWPs) as input. The results indicate that for forecasts up to 2h ahead the most important input is the available observations of solar power, while for longer horizons NWPs are the most important input. A root mean square error improvement of around 35\% is achieved by the ARX model compared to a proposed reference model.},

@article{Cheng2011,
abstract = {This paper presents the development, evaluation and application of the Domestic Energy and Carbon Model (DECM) for predicting the energy consumptions and carbon dioxide emissions of the existing English housing stock. A novel feature of DECM is the adoption of an occupancy pattern model which is derived from the household employment status data. We believe this modification has significantly improved the accuracy of the estimation in space heating energy use. At national level, the model estimation of carbon emissions and gas and electricity consumptions are respectively 4.5\%, 3.4\% and 1.0\% higher than the national statistics. At the sub-national level (Local Authority), two methods are used to produce estimations: one based on dwelling type and the other based on socio-economic class. For both methods, the correlations between the model estimations and the government records are statistically significant and substantial (all rs > 0.9 and ps<0.01). According to the results, it can be inferred that over 85\% of the variance in dwelling energy consumptions and carbon emissions can be accounted for by dwelling type and the socio-economic class of households. The paper presents a local sensitivity analysis which examines the effects of various building fabric and service system parameters on the modelled average carbon emissions per dwelling. Based on the findings, a set of predictive charts are developed which can provide rapid estimations of the effect of various energy efficiency measures on dwelling energy consumptions and carbon emissions taking into account the potential rebound effect. In summary, this paper shows that the DECM model can be a useful tool to assist the formation of energy efficiency policies at both national and local levels.},

abstract = {Energy-consumption data collected from two equipment-retrofit projects before and after the retrofits was used to develop a model that estimates energy savings from retrofit projects. The computation method used in the model is based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The model integrates weather variables, specific equipment-usage and occupancy data, and building-operation schedules into the pre-retrofit energy-usage pattern. It then estimates the energy usage of the pre-retrofit equipment in the post-retrofit period by using weather data, occupancy, and building-operation schedules in the post-retrofit period. The difference between the recorded energy usage of the post-retrofit equipment and the predicted energy usage of the pre-retrofit equipment in the post-retrofit period is the estimate of energy savings. For the two retrofit projects used in the ANN model, the coefficient of correlation varied from 0.957 to 0.844; the root mean square error varied from 6.81\% to 16.4\%; and the mean absolute error varied from 5.31\% to 9.95\%. Additionally, the sensitivity of the model to the input variables was analyzed with one of the retrofit project data. Dry bulb temperature, wet bulb temperature, and time (representing building-occupancy and equipment-operation schedule) were determined as the most effective variables in the ANN model.

We rely on this event, account for the endogeneity of price and payment plan with consumption through a plan selection correction term, and find that the provision of information is associated with a decline in electricity consumption of 11–17\%. We find that the reduction is robust to different specifications, selection-bias correction methods and subsamples of the original data. The advanced metering program delivers reasonably cost-effective reductions in carbon dioxide emissions, even under the most conservative usage reduction scenarios.},

@article{Keirstead2006,
abstract = {Domestic energy consumption (DEC) has been traditionally understood using disciplinary perspectives, focusing on specific components of the energy consumption system such as technologies or costs. However, early attempts to encourage energy conservation demonstrated that these frameworks often miss important contextual factors such as cultural values and behavioural interactions with technologies. This evidence, combined with the present need for energy policies that can address environmental, social, and economic concerns, suggests that a broader perspective is needed. Integrated frameworks of DEC were first proposed over 20 years ago but very little has been said about the ideas proposed in these papers, whether it be critiquing their form or assessing their impact on theory and practice. This paper attempts to fill this gap by examining the influence of integrated frameworks in academic literature and in UK energy policy. It is argued that a common language could stimulate renewed interest in the integrated perspective and thereby help policy makers meet these diverse goals. To this end, a flexible agent-based framework is proposed to stimulate debate and clarify the role of an integrated approach to domestic energy policy.},

abstract = {In this pilot study, a hitherto untapped source of fuel oil delivery data is explored as representative of a potentially powerful data source for analyses of residential oil consumption. The application of PRISM to oil data is studied in two parts: a detailed examination of a small number of houses, followed by an analysis of groups of houses in disparate (urban vs. suburban) regions. Extremely good fits to the data result, with interesting differences between houses with and without oil-fueled water heaters, and with some caveats regarding the interpretability of the results. The regional comparison shows almost no dependence on type of region or subset of houses. The most important finding is that monitoring consumption in oil-heated houses is almost as straightforward as it is in gas-heated houses, provided there are sufficient oil deliveries in the time period of interest.},

abstract = {Narrow-band dm-spikes observed during the June 15, 1991 flare are statistically analysed. The character of their frequency distributions at 237, 327, 408 and 610 MHz in both L- and R-handed circular polarizations is studied. While for the complete time intervals no simple distributions of spikes (either exponential or power-law) are recognized, for shorter intervals both exponential and power-law distributions are observed. No significant difference is found in the distributions for L- and R-polarized data. Further analysis reveals that spikes appearing in dense groups and with high intensities preferentially have exponential distributions, while the sparse spikes with lower intensities are rather characterized by power-law distribution functions with high exponents. Groups of independent spikes (cases with low rates and low intensities) have power-law distributions trend in agreement with the coherent spike mechanisms. Tests are provided regarding statistical analyses. The nonlinear analysis reveals that the degree of complexity of the system varies. It decreases when the attractor dimensions and the Lyapunov exponents assume smaller values, which happens when very strong spikes are present. The changing characteristics of the statistical parameters are probably the result of a mutual interaction in the source environment or a product of propagation conditions.},

With the emergence of the data mining approach for predictive modeling, different types of models can be built in a unified platform: to implement various modeling techniques, assess the performance of different models and select the most appropriate model for future prediction.},

@article{Summerfield2007,
abstract = {A follow-up study was undertaken of 15 ‘low-energy’ dwellings in Milton Keynes, UK, that were originally monitored for temperature and energy consumption from 1989 to 1991. These measurements were repeated in 2005–2006, with the results compared with the baseline using standardised daily external conditions of 5°C. The 2005–2006 study found mean temperatures of 19.8°C (95\% confidence interval: 19.7–20.5) for living rooms and 19.3°C (CI: 19.6–20.1) for main bedrooms. Weak evidence was found for a 10\% increase in gas consumption over 15 years to 87kWh/day (95\%CI: 77–96) and overall electricity usage rose by 30\% to 15kWh/day (CI: 13.6–16.5). Dwellings were classified into three groups of low, middle, and high-energy users in 1990. In 2005–2006, this high group consumed more energy than the other two groups combined and accounted for most increases in energy use; their gas usage rose by 20\% to 130kWh/day (110–150), electricity by 75\% to 28kWh/day (CI: 25.3–31.2), and had 50\% higher energy intensity at 172Wh/m2 (CI: 150–195). On average the high group comprised dwellings that were larger, had been extended, and whose occupants had higher incomes than the two other groups. The results suggest that research for the development of energy policy, including building regulations, should focus both on how energy is currently used and on households where the largest future increases are likely to occur.},

The past decades have seen significant improvements in building energy efficiency through the introduction of new building regulations and the construction of low energy buildings. However, the expected energy reduction has not been observed, largely due to the complicated and hard-to-predict nature of occupant behavior. This paper explores the impact of occupants on residential energy consumption in China. Surveys related to behavior and energy use in the city of Hangzhou were collected in the winter (n=642) and summer (n=838). Findings show that occupant age is a more significant factor than income. Contrary to existing research, a negative correlation between occupant age and energy consumption was found in this study. Elderly residents exhibit a more frugal behavior pattern than the younger ones. In addition, this paper reveals that household socio-economic and behavior variables are able to explain 28.8\% of the variation in heating and cooling energy consumption.},

abstract = {Implementing energy conservation measures in buildings can reduce energy costs and environmental impacts, but such measures cost money to implement so intelligent investment strategies require the ability to quantify the energy savings by comparing actual energy used to how much energy would have been used in absence of the conservation measures (known as the “baseline” energy use). Methods exist for predicting baseline energy use, but a limitation of most statistical methods reported in the literature is inadequate quantification of the uncertainty in baseline energy use predictions. However, estimation of uncertainty is essential for weighing the risks of investing in retrofits. Most commercial buildings have, or soon will have, electricity meters capable of providing data at short time intervals. These data provide new opportunities to quantify uncertainty in baseline predictions, and to do so after shorter measurement durations than are traditionally used. In this paper, we show that uncertainty estimation provides greater measurement and verification (M\&V) information and helps to overcome some of the difficulties with deciding how much data is needed to develop baseline models and to confirm energy savings. We also show that cross-validation is an effective method for computing uncertainty. In so doing, we extend a simple regression-based method of predicting energy use using short-interval meter data. We demonstrate the methods by predicting energy use in 17 real commercial buildings. We discuss the benefits of uncertainty estimates which can provide actionable decision making information for investing in energy conservation measures.},

abstract = {When the heat balance of a building is assessed, the heat needed for the ventilation air is usually calculated according to the intended ventilation rate. However, in order to calculate the air change rate accurately several aspects have to be considered. One important parameter is the ventilation system. Whether the building has a mechanical exhaust-only, supply-only, balanced exhaust–supply or natural ventilation system will influence the air infiltration rate through cracks in the building envelope. High infiltration rates lead to an increase in the heating demand and can result in an inadequate capacity of the designed heating installation. In this paper, computer simulations of the air change rate for a detached single-family house are presented. The house is simulated in different topographical surroundings, equipped with a mechanical exhaust-only, or a balanced exhaust–supply, ventilation system. In addition, the airtightness of the building is varied, from very tight, 1 air change per hour (ACH), to quite leaky, 6 ACH, when pressurized to 50Pa. Results from the simulations show that the same house has quite different air change rates in different surroundings with different airtightness.},

Based on a review of various infiltration modeling options available in EnergyPlus and sensitivity analysis, the linear wind velocity coefficient based on DOE-2 infiltration model is recommended. The methodology described in this report can be used to calculate the EnergyPlus infiltration input for any given building level infiltration rate specified at known pressure difference. The sensitivity analysis shows that EnergyPlus calculates the wind speed based on zone altitude, and the linear wind velocity coefficient represents the variation in infiltration heat loss consistent with building location and weather data. EnergyPlus infiltration input is calculated to be 0.2016 cfm/sf of exterior wall area, assuming that uncontrolled air leakage through the building envelope can be specified by a baseline leakage rate of 1.8 cfm/sf (@ 0.30 in. w.c) of exterior above grade envelope area (based on ASHRAE SSPC-90.1 Envelope Subcommittee recommendation).},

abstract = {This paper presents the results from a case study on the role in policymaking of UK Energy Sector Indicators (ESIs), introduced by the government in 2003. The findings show that the ESIs constituted a very minor element within the broader evidence-base used by policymakers, and that this indicator set and its objectives were poorly known even to central players in the sector. The findings of this research provide further evidence for the observation that scientific knowledge (including evaluations, assessments and indicators) seldom play an instrumental role in policymaking, and are more likely to produce indirect, conceptual and political impacts. The analysis provides a number of tentative conclusions concerning such potential indirect impacts that accrue mainly through processes of dialogue and argumentation both during the preparation of the indicators and after their publication as part of the annual reporting by the UK energy department. The ESIs have played various conceptual and political roles, yet the concrete outcomes in terms of policy change remain to be explored. The conclusions highlight the limitations of rationalist notions of direct, instrumental use in the efforts to understand the role of indicators in policymaking. The paper concludes by three tentative propositions concerning the explanations to the absence of instrumental role of the ESIs, which could be usefully explored in future research: the characteristics of the energy sector; the characteristics of the UK policy culture; and the exceptionality of the ESIs in the general evidence-base of UK energy sector.},

abstract = {This study estimates the combined direct and indirect rebound effects from various types of energy efficiency improvement and behavioural change by UK households and explores how these effects vary with total expenditure. The methodology is based upon estimates of the expenditure elasticity and GHG intensity of 16 categories of goods and services, and allows for the capital cost and embodied emissions of the energy efficiency measures themselves. The study finds that rebound effects, in GHG terms, are modest (0-32\%) for measures affecting domestic energy use, larger (25-65\%) for measures affecting vehicle fuel use and very large (66-106\%) for measures that reduce food waste. Furthermore, measures undertaken by low income households are associated with the largest rebound effects, with direct emissions forming a larger proportion of the total rebound effect for those households. Measures that are subsidised or affect highly taxed energy commodities may be less effective in reducing aggregate emissions. These findings highlight the importance of allowing for rebound effects within policy appraisals, as well as reinforcing the case for economy-wide carbon pricing. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This study examines the change in the space heating energy consumption and its associated cost and carbon emissions following retrofit energy efficiency upgrade. 3 to 4 week fuel consumption and temperature data were collected from some 1500 dwellings over two successive winters in 2001/2002 and 2002/2003. The case study dwellings were occupied by elderly householders or families with young children and were either awaiting or had received a combination of draught proofing, insulation and central heating measures under England’s Warm Front Scheme. The findings show that the Warm Front Scheme resulted in a mean increase of 1.6 °C in indoor temperature and a mean increase of 12 \% in fuel consumption. Nevertheless, the switch from electricity to gas for space heating following the introduction of gas boilers resulted in a mean reduction in heating cost by 7 \%. The scheme was found to have negligible impact on carbon emissions. Characteristic differences were observed with individual energy efficiency measures. Central heating resulted in the greatest temperature rise by 2.3 °C followed by insulation by 0.7 °C with a negligible impact from draught proofing. Clear evidence was found in householders increasing the demand temperature following the introduction of a central heating system while no evidence of this was found following the introduction of insulation. In terms of energy use, insulation resulted in a mean saving of 9 \% but fell short by 74 \% to 84 \% from the theoretical prediction while central heating resulted in a mean increase of 29 \% in the energy consumption. Draught proofing was found to have little impact on the energy use. When examined in terms of energy cost, insulation and central heating all resulted in mean cost savings of 13 \% and 9 \% respectively but falling short by 55 \% to 72 \% and 57 \% to 82 \% compared to their respective theoretically predicted mean cost savings. Insulation also resulted in mean carbon emissions saving of 13 \% but fell short by 56 \% to 73 \% from the theoretical prediction while central heating resulted in insignificant carbon emissions saving. Combining insulation with central heating was found to be beneficial in terms of mitigating the energy consumption rise associated with central heating from 29 \% down to 16 \% while maximizing the temperature gain by as much as 3.1 °C.},

abstract = {Multiple regression modeling of monitored building energy use data is often faulted as a reliable means of predicting energy use on the grounds that multicollinearity between the regressor variables can lead both to improper interpretation of the relative importance of the various physical regressor parameters and to a model with unstable regressor coefficients. Principal component analysis (PCA) has the potential to overcome such drawbacks. While a few case studies have already attempted to apply this technique to building energy data, the objectives of this study were to make a broader evaluation of PCA and multiple regression analysis (MRA) and to establish guidelines under which one approach is preferable to the other. Four geographic locations in the US with different climatic conditions were selected and synthetic data sequences representative of daily energy use in large institutional buildings were generated in each location using a linear model with outdoor temperature, outdoor specific humidity and solar radiation as the three regression variables. MRA and PCA approaches were then applied to these data sets and their relative performances were compared. Conditions under which PCA seems to perform better than MRA were identified and preliminary recommendations on the use of either modeling approach formulated.},

abstract = {The world appears to be emerging from the worst economic crisis in decades. Many countries have made pledges under the Copenhagen Accord to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. Commitments have also been made by the G-20 and APEC to phase out inefficient fossil-fuel subsidies. Are we, at last, on the path to a secure, reliable and environmentally sustainable energy system? Updated projections of energy demand, production, trade and investment, fuel by fuel and region by region to 2035 are provided in the 2010 edition of the World Energy Outlook (WEO). It includes, for the first time, a new scenario that anticipates future actions by governments to meet the commitments they have made to tackle climate change and growing energy insecurity. WEO-2010 shows: · what more must be done and spent to achieve the goal of the Copenhagen Accord to limit the global temperature increase to 2°C and how these actions would impact on oil markets; · how emerging economies – led by China and India – will increasingly shape the global energy landscape; · what role renewables can play in a clean and secure energy future; · what removing fossil-fuel subsidies would mean for energy markets, climate change and state budgets; · the trends in Caspian energy markets and the implications for global energy supply; · the prospects for unconventional oil; and · how to give the entire global population access to modern energy services. With extensive data, projections and analysis, WEO-2010 provides invaluable insights into how the energy system could evolve over the next quarter of a century. The book is essential reading for anyone with a stake in the energy sector.},

@book{Strogatz2014,
abstract = {This textbook is aimed at newcomers to nonlinear dynamics and chaos, especially students taking a first course in the subject. The presentation stresses analytical methods, concrete examples, and geometric intuition. The theory is developed systematically, starting with first-order differential equations and their bifurcations, followed by phase plane analysis, limit cycles and their bifurcations, and culminating with the Lorenz equations, chaos, iterated maps, period doubling, renormalization, fractals, and strange attractors. A unique feature of the book is its emphasis on applications. These include mechanical vibrations, lasers, biological rhythms, superconducting circuits, insect outbreaks, chemical oscillators, genetic control systems, chaotic waterwheels, and even a technique for using chaos to send secret messages. In each case, the scientific background is explained at an elementary level and closely integrated with mathematical theory. In the twenty years since the first edition of this book appeared, the ideas and techniques of nonlinear dynamics and chaos have found application to such exciting new fields as systems biology, evolutionary game theory, and sociophysics. This second edition includes new exercises on these cutting-edge developments, on topics as varied as the curiosities of visual perception and the tumultuous love dynamics in Gone With the Wind.},

We compare a sharp-transition model with three models incorporating smooth transitions: the hyperbolic-tangent, bent-hyperbola, and bent-cable models. We also calculate three types of confidence intervals for the breakpoint estimate: an interval based on the computed standard error of the estimate from the fitting procedure, an empirical bootstrap confidence interval, and a confidence interval derived from an inverted F test.

abstract = {Improving the efficiency and performance of the UK residential sector is now necessary for meeting future energy and climate change targets. Building performance evaluation and certification (BPEC) tools are vital for estimating and recommending cost effective improvements to building energy efficiency and lowering overall emissions. In the UK, building performance is estimated using the standard assessment procedure (SAP) for new dwellings and Reduced SAP (RdSAP) for existing dwellings. Using a systems based approach we show there are many opportunities for improving the effectiveness of BPEC tools. In particular, if the building stock is going to meet future energy and climate change targets the system driving building energy efficiency will need to become more efficient. In order to achieve this goal, building performance standards across Europe are compared highlighting the most effective strategies where they are found. It is shown that the large variance between estimated and actual energy performance from dwellings in the UK may be preventing the adoption of bottom-up energy efficiency measures. We show that despite popular belief, SAP and RdSAP do not estimate building energy efficiency but instead attempt to estimate the cost-effective performance of a building and thus create perverse incentives that may lead to additional CO2 emissions. In this regard, the SAP standard confounds cost-effectiveness, energy efficiency and environmental performance giving an inadequate estimate of all three policy objectives. Important contributions for improving measurement, analysis, synthesis and certification of building performance characteristics are offered.},

abstract = {With the rollout of smart metering infrastructure at scale, demand-response (DR) programs may now be tailored based on users' consumption patterns as mined from sensed data. For issuing DR events it is key to understand the inter-temporal consumption dynamics as to appropriately segment the user population. We propose to infer occupancy states from consumption time series data using a hidden Markov model framework. Occupancy is characterized in this model by 1) magnitude, 2) duration, and 3) variability. We show that users may be grouped according to their consumption patterns into groups that exhibit qualitatively different dynamics that may be exploited for program enrollment purposes. We investigate empirically the information that residential energy consumers' temporal energy demand patterns characterized by these three dimensions may convey about their demographic, household, and appliance stock characteristics. Our analysis shows that temporal patterns in the user's consumption data can predict with good accuracy certain user characteristics. We use this framework to argue that there is a large degree of individual predictability in user consumption at a population level.},

abstract = {The very short-term load forecasting (VSTLF) problem is of particular interest for use in smart grid and automated demand response applications. An effective solution for VSTLF can facilitate real-time electricity deployment and improve its quality. In this paper, a novel approach to model the very short-term load of individual households based on context information and daily schedule pattern analysis is proposed. Several daily behavior pattern types were obtained by analyzing the time series of daily electricity consumption, and context features from various sources were collected and used to establish a rule set for use in anticipating the likely behavior pattern type of a specific day. Meanwhile, an electricity consumption volume prediction model was developed for each behavior pattern type to predict the load at a specific time point in a day. This study was concerned with solving the VSTLF for individual households in Taiwan. The proposed approach obtained an average mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 3.23\% and 2.44\% for forecasting individual household load and aggregation load 30-min ahead, respectively, which is more favorable than other methods.},

abstract = {Benchmarking energy-efficiency is an important tool to promote the efficient use of energy in commercial buildings. Benchmarking models are mostly constructed in a simple benchmark table (percentile table) of energy use, which is normalized with floor area and temperature. This paper describes a benchmarking process for energy efficiency by means of multiple regression analysis, where the relationship between energy-use intensities (EUIs) and the explanatory factors (e.g., operating hours) is developed. Using the resulting regression model, these EUIs are then normalized by removing the effect of deviance in the significant explanatory factors. The empirical cumulative distribution of the normalized EUI gives a benchmark table (or percentile table of EUI) for benchmarking an observed EUI. The advantage of this approach is that the benchmark table represents a normalized distribution of EUI, taking into account all the significant explanatory factors that affect energy consumption. An application to supermarkets is presented to illustrate the development and the use of the benchmarking method.},

This paper introduces a hybrid framework developed to assess future household energy demand in France. Res-IRF, a bottom–up module of energy consumption for space heating, has several distinctive features: (i) a clear separation between energy efficiency, i.e. investment in energy efficient technologies, and sufficiency, i.e. changes in the utilization of energy consuming durables which allows the rebound effect to be assessed; (ii) the inclusion of barriers to energy efficiency in the form of intangible costs, consumer heterogeneity parameters and the learning-by-doing process; (iii) an endogenous determination of retrofitting which represents trade-offs between retrofit quantity and quality. Subsequently, Res-IRF is linked to the IMACLIM-R computable general equilibrium model. This exercise shows that, compared to a 37\% reduction in final energy demand achievable in business as usual in existing dwellings in 2050, an additional reduction of 21\% could be achieved if relevant barriers to efficiency and sufficiency were overcome.},

We show how this approach can be used to study significant changes in dynamical systems due to a change in control parameters, chaos-order as well as chaos-chaos transitions. Finally we study and discuss climate transitions by analysing a marine proxy record for past sea surface temperature.

abstract = {This paper presents the results of testing BREDEM-8 and BREDEM-12 against measurements in real dwellings and against detailed simulation models. BREDEM-8 is a monthly calculation whereas BREDEM-12 works on a nominal heating season of 8 months. The BREDEM-8 results have been presented before but it is instructive to present them here again because this highlights the performance of the two versions of BREDEM relative to one another. Often all that is required of an energy calculation is a prediction of annual energy use. The results obtained indicate that in this respect the two versions of BREDEM are as good as the detailed simulation models. Both versions of BREDEM perform well in both types of test, and the predictions from the simpler seasonal calculation are as good as those from the more complex monthly calculation. This suggests that for many purposes, and in particular for those where a hand calculation option needs to be available, a seasonal calculation is quite adequate. For example, there is no point in basing an energy label such as the Standard Assessment Procedure on anything more complicated than a seasonal calculation. In situations where a computer would always be used to do the calculations, either a seasonal or a monthly calculation could be employed.

abstract = {It is shown that the intrinsic geometry associated with equilibrium thermodynamics, namely the contact geometry, provides also a suitable framework in order to deal with irreversible thermodynamical processes. Therefore we introduce a class of dynamical systems on contact manifolds, called conservative contact systems, defined as contact vector fields generated by some contact Hamiltonian function satisfying a compatibility condition with some Legendre submanifold of the contact manifold. Considering physical systems' modeling, the Legendre submanifold corresponds to the definition of the thermodynamical properties of the system and the contact Hamiltonian function corresponds to the definition of some irreversible processes taking place in the system. Open thermodynamical systems may also be modeled by augmenting the conservative contact systems with some input and output variables (in the sense of automatic control) and so-called input vector fields and lead to the definition of port contact systems. Finally complex systems consisting of coupled simple thermodynamical or mechanical systems may be represented by the composition of such port contact systems through algebraic relations called interconnection structure. Two examples illustrate this composition of contact systems: a gas under a piston submitted to some external force and the conduction of heat between two media with external thermostat. ?? 2007 Polish Scientific Publishers PWN, Warszawa.},

abstract = {Results are presented from a monitoring study of the electricity consumption of a sample of UK domestic buildings. Five-minutely average whole house power consumption was recorded for 72 dwellings at five sites over a 2-year monitoring period. The mean annual electricity consumption for the households increased significantly by 4.5\% (t=1.9; p<0.05, one-tailed) from the first to the second year of monitoring. New techniques are developed which estimate the electricity consumption of different appliance groups, based on analysis of the five-minutely monitored data. The overall increase in electricity consumption is attributed to a 10.2\% increase in the consumption of ‘standby’ appliances (such as televisions and consumer electronics) and a 4.7\% increase in the consumption of ‘active’ appliance (such as lighting, kettles and electric showers). The consumption of different energy user groups (low, medium and high) is also investigated and low and high users are identified as contributing to the overall increase in consumption. The need for further investigation, such as quantitative and qualitative studies, to improve understanding in domestic electricity consumption is discussed.},

We find that using the more widespread methods, and the more usual data and model specification, may lead to sensibly different estimates. We find in particular that simultaneity tends to interact with selectivity, and that both sources of biases must be taken into account together.

abstract = {Retrofitting existing buildings is urgent given the increasing need to improve the energy efficiency of the existing building stock. This paper presents a scalable, probabilistic methodology that can support large scale investments in energy retrofit of buildings while accounting for uncertainty. The methodology is based on Bayesian calibration of normative energy models. Based on CEN-ISO standards, normative energy models are light-weight, quasi-steady state formulations of heat balance equations, which makes them appropriate for modeling large sets of buildings efficiently. Calibration of these models enables improved representation of the actual buildings and quantification of uncertainties associated with model parameters. In addition, the calibrated models can incorporate additional uncertainties coming from retrofit interventions to generate probabilistic predictions of retrofit performance. Probabilistic outputs can be straightforwardly translated to quantify risks of under-performance associated with retrofit interventions. A case study demonstrates that the proposed methodology with the use of normative models can correctly evaluate energy retrofit options and support risk conscious decision-making by explicitly inspecting risks associated with each retrofit option.},

It is increasingly recognized that these actions may also have near-term effects on health arising from changes to the indoor environment. As part of a major study of such health effects, we modelled hypothetical household energy interventions for the UK of the type and scale needed to meet near-term (nominally 2030) abatement targets. Here we provide details of the elements of our model that address the relationships between the fabric and ventilation improvements and changes in indoor temperature during the heating season – the ‘temperature take back factor’. We demonstrate that the scale of these interventions is consistent with the emission reductions proposed by the UK Climate Change Committee, and estimate that, in the UK the consequent reduction in exposure to indoor cold may result in around 4400 fewer disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) each year. The inclusion of the temperature take back factor for the fabric and ventilation interventions reduces the relevant expected CO2 reductions by \~{} 6\%. Practical},

abstract = {Measurements of energy consumption in dwellings show that the consumption is normally distributed. The variation is wide. A statistical simulation method based on the Monte Carlo technique is used to study variation of energy consumption in dwellings. Uncertain parameters such as internal temperature and air change are assumed as distributions. Values for each parameter distribution are combined randomly. The probable energy consumption is simulated and given as a distribution instead as a single value. The method is used to study the influence of variation from climate, building and inhabitants. Variation from inhabitants is much more significant than variation from climate. It is therefore important to know the variation from inhabitants' behaviour. If the inhabitants' behaviour is unknown, it is impossible to predict the total energy consumption more accurately than ±15–20\% compared with the consumption found with traditional energy calculation methods. The heating and ventilation energy consumption is encumbered with an uncertainty of ±25–40\% if the inhabitants' behaviour is unknown. In a cold climate it is most important to study uncertainties of transmission and ventilation loss.},

abstract = {This paper examines residential energy use in the Scandinavian countries: Denmark, Norway and Sweden, over the period 1973–1999. The paper uses a decomposition approach to investigate differences in residential energy demand structure and end-use intensities and discusses both differences in absolute levels of energy use and differences over time. Comparisons are also made to other countries that have been analysed in the IEA energy efficiency indicator project. The analysis shows that, in contrast to Denmark and Sweden, Norway saw a growth in total residential energy use between 1973 and 1999. This can be partially explained by the fact that Norway started from a lower per capita income level in the early 1970s but has since then enjoyed a rapid income growth that drove up house area and consequently put a pressure on energy use. But the analysis also shows that Denmark and Sweden achieved significant reductions of residential energy intensities between 1973 and 1990, while the reductions in Norway were negligible. After 1990, the picture changed; there was a strong decline in residential energy intensities in Norway and a high rate of energy savings compared to most other countries analysed by the IEA, while energy savings in Denmark and Sweden more or less came to a halt.},

This study sought to define a core specification for these real-time energy displays, derived from a qualitative investigation of consumer experience of the electricity displays currently available on the market. The study recruited a total of 38 participants to five demographically differentiated focus groups, each of which met twice. At the first meeting, each group designed an ideal home energy display based on participants' ideas of what they thought such a display ought to include. Participants then spent a week using existing models at home. At the second meeting, the groups reviewed their experience and revised their designs accordingly. The study found remarkable convergence in the groups' final designs, enabling the clear specification of a core set of features and functionality for home energy displays. Only one of the displays used in the study, the GEO minim, comes close to meeting this specification. Despite a relatively well developed display industry in the UK, the majority of the home energy displays currently on the market do not have the functionality that consumers identify, in practice, as being critical to display design. Hence `the market' cannot be relied on to deliver an outcome that is optimal for consumers.},

Studies have shown that occupant behaviour might play a prominent role in the variation in energy consumption in different households but the extent of such influence is unknown. The impact of the building's thermal characteristics on space heating demand has been well studied. There is however, little work done that incorporates the impact of consumer behaviour. This study aims to gain greater insight into the effect of occupant behaviour on energy consumption for space heating by determining its effect on the variation of energy consumption in dwellings while controlling for building characteristics. The KWR database from the Ministry of Housing in the Netherlands was used. This study showed that occupant characteristics and behaviour significantly affect energy use (4.2\%), but building characteristics still determine a large part of the energy use in a dwelling (42\%). Further analysis showed that some occupant behaviour is determined by the type of dwelling or HVAC systems and, therefore, the effect of occupant characteristics might be larger than expected, since these determine the type of dwelling.},

abstract = {To make robust judgments of an energy efficiency programme's economic effectiveness, we need to know how much energy and CO2 is actually being saved through the financial support it provides. But most evaluations of home retrofit energy efficiency programmes depend on calculated, rather than measured, levels of energy consumption. This fails to take into account the discrepancies that have been observed in practice, between calculated and actual energy consumption both before and after refurbishment. Evaluations of energy efficiency programmes ideally need to consider rebound effects, free rider effects, reduced savings due to insufficient technical quality, and discrepancies between actual and calculated pre-refurbishment energy consumption. This paper investigates and compares evaluations of two prominent energy efficiency programmes in the Germany and UK–the CO2-Building Rehabilitation Programme and the Supplier Obligation. We show that evaluations of the Supplier Obligation explicitly address most of the reduction effects whereas this is not the case for the CO2-Building Rehabilitation Programme.},

abstract = {Financial data has been extensively studied for correlations using Pearson’s cross-correlation coefficient $\rho$ as the point of departure. We employ an estimator based on recurrence plots — the correlation of probability of recurrence (CPR) — to analyze connections between nine stock indices spread worldwide. We suggest a slight modification of the CPR approach in order to get more robust results. We examine trends in CPR for an approximately 19-month window moved along the time series and compare them to trends in $\rho$. Binning CPR into three levels of connectedness (strong, moderate, and weak), we extract the trends in number of connections in each bin over time. We also look at the behavior of CPR during the dot-com bubble by shifting the time series to align their peaks. CPR mainly uncovers that the markets move in and out of periods of strong connectivity erratically, instead of moving monotonically towards increasing global connectivity. This is in contrast to $\rho$, which gives a picture of ever-increasing correlation. CPR also exhibits that time-shifted markets have high connectivity around the dot-com bubble of 2000. We use significance tests using twin surrogates to interpret all the measures estimated in the study.},

abstract = {Whole building energy simulation (BES) models play a significant role in the design and optimisation of buildings. Simulation models may be used to compare the cost-effectiveness of energy-conservation measures (ECMs) in the design stage as well as assessing various performance optimisation measures during the operational stage. However, due to the complexity of the built environment and prevalence of large numbers of independent interacting variables, it is difficult to achieve an accurate representation of real-world building operation. Therefore, by reconciling model outputs with measured data, we can achieve more accurate and reliable results. This reconciliation of model outputs with measured data is known as calibration. This paper presents a detailed review of current approaches to model development and calibration, highlighting the importance of uncertainty in the calibration process. This is accompanied by a detailed assessment of the various analytical and mathematical/statistical tools employed by practitioners to date, as well as a discussion on both the problems and the merits of the presented approaches.},

abstract = {Repeated surveys of occupant control of the indoor environment were carried out in Danish dwellings from September to October 2006 and again from February to March 2007. The summer survey comprised 933 respondents and the winter survey 636 respondents. The surveys were carried out by sending out invitations to addresses obtained from a Danish register along with information on dwelling characteristics. Meteorological data was obtained from the Danish Meteorological Institute. Four control mechanisms (window open/closed, heating on/off, lighting on/off and solar shading in/not in use) were analysed separately by means of multiple logistic regression in order to quantify factors influencing occupants’ behaviour. The window opening behaviour was strongly related to the outdoor temperature. The perception of the environment and factors concerning the dwelling also impacted the window opening behaviour. The proportion of dwellings with the heating turned on was strongly related to the outdoor temperature and the presence of a wood burning stove. The solar radiation, dwelling ownership conditions and the perception of the indoor environment also affected the use of heating. The results of the statistical analyses form a basis for a definition of standard behaviour patterns which can be used to make calculation of energy consumption of buildings more accurate.},

abstract = {Many of the popular building energy simulation programs around the world are reaching maturity — some use simulation methods (and even code) that originated in the 1960s. For more than two decades, the US government supported development of two hourly building energy simulation programs, BLAST and DOE-2. Designed in the days of mainframe computers, expanding their capabilities further has become difficult, time-consuming, and expensive. At the same time, the 30 years have seen significant advances in analysis and computational methods and power — providing an opportunity for significant improvement in these tools. In 1996, a US federal agency began developing a new building energy simulation tool, EnergyPlus, building on development experience with two existing programs: DOE-2 and BLAST. EnergyPlus includes a number of innovative simulation features — such as variable time steps, user-configurable modular systems that are integrated with a heat and mass balance-based zone simulation — and input and output data structures tailored to facilitate third party module and interface development. Other planned simulation capabilities include multizone airflow, and electric power and solar thermal and photovoltaic simulation. Beta testing of EnergyPlus began in late 1999 and the first release is scheduled for early 2001.},

abstract = {Complex systems research is becoming ever more important in both the natural and social sciences. It is commonly implied that there is such a thing as a complex system, different examples of which are studied across many disciplines. However, there is no concise definition of a complex system, let alone a definition on which all scientists agree. We review various attempts to characterize a complex system, and consider a core set of features that are widely associated with complex systems in the literature and by those in the field. We argue that some of these features are neither necessary nor sufficient for complexity, and that some of them are too vague or confused to be of any analytical use. In order to bring mathematical rigour to the issue we then review some standard measures of complexity from the scientific literature, and offer a taxonomy for them, before arguing that the one that best captures the qualitative notion of the order produced by complex systems is that of the Statistical Complexity. Finally, we offer our own list of necessary conditions as a characterization of complexity. These conditions are qualitative and may not be jointly sufficient for complexity. We close with some suggestions for future work.},

abstract = {It is important to know how to design a building to meet seasonally varying energy needs. In high latitude countries in winter the demand for space heating is high and a building envelope should receive maximum incident solar energy. On the other hand, in summer, walls and roofs exposed to incident solar radiation usually require shading to avoid too much solar gain. Data on solar energy availability are crucial for good building design. However, it is important how the availability of solar radiation is determined. An important aim of the paper presented is to give some results of a comparative analysis of two basic sky models, isotropic: Hottel–Woertz–Liu–Jordan and anisotropic: the HDKR, Hay–Davies–Klucher–Reindl, to recommend one of these models for determination of solar energy availability on a building envelope and to formulate the energy balance of a building. Differences between results obtained from both models increase with the slope of exposed surfaces. The biggest differences (12–15\%) are evident for vertical south surfaces, especially in summer. The simplified isotropic sky model is not recommended for evaluation of solar radiation availability on the building envelope. Underestimation of solar gains can lead to the selection of an unsuitable concept and construction of a building and result in poor indoor thermal comfort, i.e. overheating of rooms in summer.},

These shifts are determined by the outcome of an unobserved two-state indicator variable that follows a Markov process with unknown transition probabilities. A Bayesian framework is developed in which the unobserved states, one for each time point, are treated as missing data and then analyzed via the simulation tool of Gibbs sampling. This method is expedient because the conditional posterior distribution of the parameters, given the states, and the conditional posterior distribution of the states, given the parameters, all have a form amenable to Monte Carlo sampling. The approach is straightforward and generates marginal posterior distributions for all parameters of interest. Posterior distributions of the states, future observations, and the residuals, averaged over the parameter space are also obtained.

BREDEM-1 is a simple single-zone model designed for hand calculations; its predictive capabilities have been tested on a group of over forty dwellings2. Major extensions to the BREDEM-1 model to include two zones and also incorporating changes to the way in which internal and external temperatures are handled, resulted in BREDEM-23. Like its predecessor, BREDEM-2 is designed for hand calculations, although a number of closely related computer based versions have been developed. These are also called BREDEM and are given individual identification numbers. This paper tests the predictions of BREDEM-5 (also known as Energy Auditor) using the same sample as was used for BREDEM-1 testing. The two-zone model is found to be an improvement on BREDEM-1, there being less scatter in the results. Even so, the paper identifies potential areas for improvement.},

Using an ‘actor oriented approach’, the paper tries to identify (a) the drivers and barriers that affect the success or failure of energy efficiency investments and (b) the institutions that are responsible for the emergence of these barriers and drivers. This taxonomy aims to synthesise ideas from three broad perspectives, viz., micro (project/end user), meso (organization), and macro (state, market, civil society). The paper develops a systematic framework by looking at the issues from the perspective of different actors. This not only aids the understanding of barriers and drivers; it also provides scope for appropriate policy interventions. This focus will help policy-makers evaluate to what extent future interventions may be warranted and how one can judge the success of particular interventions.},

abstract = {Energy consumption from the residential sector is a complex socio-technical problem that can be explained using a combination of physical, demographic and behavioural characteristics of a dwelling and its occupants. A structural equation model (SEM) is introduced to calculate the magnitude and significance of explanatory variables on residential energy consumption. The benefit of this approach is that it explains the complex relationships that exist between manifest variables and their overall effect though direct, indirect and total effects. Using the English House Condition Survey (EHCS) consisting of 2531 unique cases, the main drivers behind residential energy consumption are found to be the number of household occupants, floor area, household income, dwelling efficiency (SAP), household heating patterns and living room temperature. In the multivariate case, SAP explains very little of the variance of residential energy consumption. However, this procedure fails to account for simultaneity bias between energy consumption and SAP. Using SEM its shown that dwelling energy efficiency (SAP), has reciprocal causality with dwelling energy consumption and the magnitude of these two effects are calculable. When non-recursivity between SAP and energy consumption is allowed for, SAP is shown to have a negative effect on energy consumption but conversely, homes with a propensity to consume more energy also have higher SAP rates.},

It describes how software tools can be used to derive predictors from the plan form of dwellings extracted from digital maps and, using a new default-data system, to satisfy the large data requirements of an embedded version of the BREDEM-8 domestic energy model. Energy consumption and CO2emissions of urban dwellings can be predicted quickly and robustly without costly on-site measurements or statistically derived geometrical models. Urban areas of almost arbitrary size can be modelled and accuracy can be incrementally improved with additional data. The model is validated by comparison with results produced by the UK's National Home Energy Rating scheme software using complete site-surveyed datasets. Its ability to rapidly estimate energy demand is demonstrated for around 400 dwellings in Leicester, UK using only the dwelling age, the default data system and the GIS tools.},

@article{Wiedermann2013,
abstract = {Many real-world complex systems are adequately represented by networks of interacting or
 interdependent networks. Additionally, it is often reasonable to take into account node weights such
 as surface area in climate networks, volume in brain networks, or economic capacity in trade
 networks to reflect the varying size or importance of subsystems. Combining both ideas, we derive a
 novel class of statistical measures for analysing the structure of networks of interacting networks
 with heterogeneous node weights. Using a prototypical spatial network model, we show that the newly
 introduced node-weighted interacting network measures provide an improved representation of the
 underlying system's properties as compared to their unweighted analogues. We apply our method to
 study the complex network structure of cross-boundary trade between European Union (EU) and non-EU
 countries finding that it provides relevant information on trade balance and economic robustness.},

abstract = {This paper is an introduction to model selection intended for nonspecialists who have knowledge of the statistical concepts covered in a typical first (occasionally second) statistics course. The intention is to explain the ideas that generate frequentist methodology for model selection, for example the Akaike information criterion, bootstrap criteria, and cross-validation criteria. Bayesian methods, including the Bayesian information criterion, are also mentioned in the context of the framework outlined in the paper. The ideas are illustrated using an example in which observations are available for the entire population of interest. This enables us to examine and to measure effects that are usually invisible, because in practical applications only a sample from the population is observed. The problem of selection bias, a hazard of which one needs to be aware in the context of model selection, is also discussed.},

The paper first shows typical problems in data measuring, especially considering smart metering infrastructure. The objective is to discuss and test detection and filling algorithms in several load time series of a real distribution utility. The impact of these algorithms is evaluated under a data mining approach, and results demonstrate the benefits that can be obtained in other applications like, load forecasting.},

@article{Branco2004,
abstract = {The “Solar Complex of Plan-les-Ouates” is a traditional multifamily building with some commercial and administrative areas. It was designed to consume a minimum amount of thermal energy by combining several renewable energy systems (1400m2 of solar roof, buried pipe and exhausted air heat exchangers) with an optimised envelope and electrical equipment. Initially predicted to consume 160MJ/m2 per year of gas, a gas energy use index (per unit heated floor area) of 246MJ/m2 per year was measured. The energy analysis of the building, based on a 3-year period of monitoring, brought up the most relevant points that explain this difference: the real conditions of utilisation (such as the interior temperature) and the real performance of the complete technical system are not taken into account in the theoretical value. Both technical and economical aspects of the renewable energy systems were analysed in detail. An important lesson learned from this experiment is that the energy concept of buildings must be simple and consistent and the complexity of the technical installations must be carefully managed from the design-stage to the exploitation. Detailed monitoring of innovative low-energy buildings is recommended to understand the possible discrepancies between theoretical and real heat consumption and to improve the transfer of new energy technologies to large-scale real constructions.},

@article{Hastie2009,
abstract = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it has come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting-the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie wrote much of the statistical modeling software in S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the Lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, and projection pursuit. FROM THE REVIEWS: TECHNOMETRICS "This is a vast and complex book. Generally, it concentrates on explaining why and how the methods work, rather than how to use them. Examples and especially the visualizations are principle features...As a source for the methods of statistical learning...it will probably be a long time before there is a competitor to this book."},

Unfortunately, it is unavoidable that load curves contain corrupted data and missing data due to various random failure factors in meters and transfer processes. This paper presents the B-Spline smoothing and Kernel smoothing based techniques to automatically cleanse corrupted and missing data. In implementation, a man-machine dialogue procedure is proposed to enhance the performance. The experiment results on the real British Columbia Transmission Corporation (BCTC) load curve data demonstrated the effectiveness of the presented solution.},
